===============

Goal is to add all Australian government sites to [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).

Status
-------

2/11 chunks merged with HTTPS Everywhere (Each chunk has 10 rules)

Setup
--------

* I used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2f68bde48289)'s 512mb droplet with Ubuntu 14.04 x64.
* `apt-get install nodejs npm php5`
* `npm install cheerio request`

Production Quality?
-------------------
These are quick and dirty scripts to get the job done! The data ends up being reviewed manually.
