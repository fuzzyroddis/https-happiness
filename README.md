Goal is to add all Australian government sites to [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).

Setup
--------

* I used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2f68bde48289)'s 512mb droplet with Ubuntu 14.04 x64.
* `apt-get install nodejs npm`
* `npm install cheerio request`
