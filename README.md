Goal is to add all Australian government sites to HTTPS Everywhere.

Packages
--------

* `apt-get install nodejs npm phantomjs`
* `npm install cheerio request webshot`

Notes
-----
* On debian based systems you'll need to `ln -s nodejs node` in /usr/bin
* Script uses a lot of memory, so you'll need to keep running till it finishes
